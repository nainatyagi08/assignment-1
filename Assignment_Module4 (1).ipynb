    "Python's popularity as a programming language is due to several key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability and Simplicity: Python’s syntax is clear and concise, making it easy to read and write. This readability reduces the cost of program maintenance and allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about complex syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that cater to various needs, such as NumPy and pandas for data analysis, Django and Flask for web development, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python runs on many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various distributions of Linux, which makes it a versatile choice for developers working in diverse environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Community Support: Python has a large and active community. This means plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums are available for support, making it easier for both beginners and experienced developers to find solutions to their problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Integration Capabilities: Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies. For instance, it can invoke C/C++ libraries, work with Java via Jython, and integrate with .NET components through IronPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means code is executed line-by-line. This makes debugging easier and provides immediate feedback, which is beneficial during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, meaning that variables do not need an explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The type of a variable is determined at runtime, making the code more flexible and easier to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Extensibility: Python can be extended with modules written in C or C++, which allows developers to improve performance in critical sections of their code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mutable objects can be changed in place without creating a new object.\n",

    "Immutable: strings, tuples, integers, floats.\n",

    "3.Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable objects can be more memory efficient when performing numerous changes, as they do not require creating new objects.\n",
    "Immutable objects can be simpler to reason about and can help avoid side effects, as their state cannot change after creation.\n",

    "4.Hashability:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable objects are generally not hashable and cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",

    "Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "State Preservation: Any attempt to change the object results in the creation of a new object.\n",
    "Methods: Do not have methods that allow modification of their content (e.g., strings have replace which returns a new string)."
